# Neutrino Oscillations
## Summary
Second lab experiment from my third year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester.

The aim of this experiment was to investigate neutrino oscillations using data from the MicroBooNE detector. The primary focus was to isolate muon neutrino signals from back- ground events using selection cuts and machine learning techniques. By analysing the energy of neutrino tracks, confidence regions were constructed for a two-flavour neutrino parameter space. These were propagated into a 3+1 model parameter space and were used to reject proposed parameters for a theoretical sterile neutrino by the LSND and MiniBooNE experiments.

## Technical Highlights
* Supervised Machine Learning using SKlearn
* Advanced Statistical analysis including Chi-Square contour plots for confidence regions and parameter error
* Fitting functions using Chi-Square minimisation
* Data visualisation using Seaborn and Matplotlib
* Confusion Matrices
* Advanced linear algebra for neutrino oscillation derivations
* Comparison of results from using selection cuts and machine learning
