# Neutrino-Oscillations
Fourth lab experiment from my third year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester.

* MainAnalysis_template.ipynb contains the main code for the experiment. This included visualising data, making selection cuts, creating a supervised classification machine learning model and doing chi squared analysis to validate results.
* MicroBooNE_Y3_Labbook.pdf contains the instructions given to me at the start of the experiment. This gives a brief overview of the experiment. It is worth nothing that this does not include any description of my added extensions
* Neutrino Oscillations Report.pdf contains my written lab report for this experiment. This contains the experimental process and theory in the academic format.
* Lab Notebook.pdf contains my handwritten notes from during the experiment including schematic diagrams, key figures, snippets of the recorded data, calculations, data analysis and conclusions.
